    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: Apr 3, 2025</p> <!-- TODO: Update this date if needed -->

    <p><strong>PhoDone</strong> ("the App") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The App requires access to your camera to capture images for tasks. These images are stored locally on your device using Core Data and are not uploaded to external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage the one-time lifetime purchase for the App's premium features. RevenueCat may store purchase information anonymously to validate and manage access to these features.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics to monitor and improve the App's stability. Firebase collects anonymous diagnostic data (like device type, OS version, and crash logs) to help identify crashes and performance issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect or store personal data identifiable to you directly.</li>
        <li>Camera access is solely for the purpose of capturing task images, which remain stored locally on your device under your control.</li>
        <li>RevenueCat collects data anonymously for purchase processing and validation.</li>
        <li>Firebase Crashlytics collects anonymous data solely for improving app stability and performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used for managing the one-time purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> Used for crash reporting and diagnostics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third-party services process data according to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies for more information.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data handled by the App. All images and task information created within the App are stored locally on your device and are protected by your device's built-in security measures. We do not have access to this locally stored data. Data handled by third-party services (RevenueCat, Firebase) is subject to their respective security practices.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age threshold in other jurisdictions), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the applicable age threshold, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since PhoDone primarily stores data locally on your device and does not collect personally identifiable information directly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can delete task images and associated data manually from within the App at any time.</li>
        <li>Information related to your one-time purchase is managed through your Apple account and processed anonymously by RevenueCat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>As the App stores your core data (task images) locally on your device, there are no international data transfers of this data conducted by us. Third-party services like RevenueCat and Firebase Crashlytics operate globally and may transfer data across borders according to their own privacy policies and data processing agreements.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or by other appropriate means. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@phodone.com">support@phodone.com</a>.</p>
