    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: May 30, 2023</p>
    
    <p><strong>PhoDone</strong> ("the App") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The App requires access to your camera to capture images for tasks. These images are stored locally on your device in Core Data and are not uploaded to external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase History:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and purchases. RevenueCat may store purchase history anonymously.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics to monitor and improve the App's stability. Firebase collects anonymous diagnostic data to help identify crashes and performance issues.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect or store personal data.</li>
        <li>Camera access is solely for capturing task images, which remain on your device.</li>
        <li>RevenueCat and Firebase collect data anonymously for subscriptions and crash reporting.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>RevenueCat (for managing purchases)</li>
        <li>Firebase Crashlytics (for crash reporting)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services may process data according to their own privacy policies.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data. All images and task information are stored locally on your device and protected by your device's security measures. We do not have access to this data.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will promptly delete that information.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since PhoDone does not store personal data, there is no data deletion request process. However, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete task images manually from the App.</li>
        <li>Manage your purchases via your Apple ID settings.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>As the App stores data locally on your device, there are no international data transfers conducted by us. Third-party services like RevenueCat and Firebase Crashlytics may transfer data according to their own privacy policies.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated policy. We will notify you of any significant changes through the App or by other means.</p>
