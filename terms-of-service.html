    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: June 18, 2024</p> <!-- TODO: Update this date if needed -->

    <p>Welcome to PhoDone! By downloading, accessing, or using the PhoDone mobile application ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>PhoDone is a task management application designed to help users organize tasks by associating them with images captured via the device camera.</li>
        <li>All task data, including images, are stored locally on your device using Core Data. The App does not upload or store this data on external servers.</li>
        <li>You agree to use the App in compliance with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your device and the confidentiality of the data stored within the App on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. One-Time Purchase for Premium Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>PhoDone offers premium features accessible through a one-time lifetime purchase ("Lifetime Purchase"). This purchase grants you access to all current and future premium functionalities designated as part of the lifetime plan.</li>
        <li>The Lifetime Purchase is processed through the Apple App Store and is subject to Apple's terms and conditions regarding payments.</li>
        <li>This is a single, non-recurring charge. Once purchased, you will have access to the premium features for the lifetime of the App, subject to these Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>All purchases, including the Lifetime Purchase, are final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or as determined by Apple's App Store policies. If you believe you are entitled to a refund, please contact Apple Support.</p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App and its original content, features, and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof) are owned by PhoDone, its licensors, or other providers of such material and are protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.</p>
    <p>These Terms permit you to use the App for your personal, non-commercial use only. You must not reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, republish, download, store, or transmit any of the material on our App, except as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your device may temporarily store copies of such materials in RAM incidental to your accessing and viewing those materials.</li>
        <li>You may store files that are automatically cached by your device for display enhancement purposes.</li>
        <li>You may use the App's inherent functionalities for creating and managing your tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PHODONE, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE APP, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE APP OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE.</p>
    <p>THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

    <h2>6. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the App, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, if you breach these Terms.</p>
    <p>Upon termination, your right to use the App will immediately cease. Provisions of these Terms that, by their nature, should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may revise and update these Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of the App following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. Significant changes may be communicated through the App or other means.</p>

    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the App developer is legally established, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
